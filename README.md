Working for Samsung devices only and any devices added after are untested.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU RUN ANY ROM THAT IS NOT LISTED ON A DUAL BOOTABLE DEVICE FIRST!
I am NOT responsible for any damage that occurs to your device or its software use at your own risk
If you have any questions please email me at risexatxnight@outlook.com.
The current idea is that nightly updates will roll out after the first stable version is made I WILL NOT
send out any software that is not stable on the devices listed in the patch notes that will be in the updates README
so make sure that you read it before installing on your device. Once again, If you install a peice of software from me I am
not responsible for the outcome, this is all up to you and use at your own risk.
