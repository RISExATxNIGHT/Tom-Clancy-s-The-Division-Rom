These are scripts tested on Samsung galaxy s3 (im sure they will work on others fine) but test first:)
some of these wont be on every phone but they need testin later I will add a confirmation in patch notes for these
No Boot Animation
debug.sf.nobootanimation=1
I would turn off boot animation if you are using an Boost Phone because the animation is super long
especially if you are runing an encrypted phone it cycles twice.

View CPU info
cat/proc/cpuinfo

Touch response
debug.perfomance.tuning=1
video.accelerate.hw=1

Minimum brightness for Screen
ro.lcd_min_brightness=20
I didnt need to mess around with the brightness but i actually wish it was brighter.
if anyone has a script for inscreased max brightness i don't want to guess.
(ro.lcd_max_brightness=XX maybe?)
There are literally Forums from XDA with multiple guides on all BuildProp and Normal Scripts I changed
Just look up your model of phone and the buildProp you want to go with that build and you will find it no problem
